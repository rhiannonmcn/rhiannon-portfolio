## Site Structure

This website consists of a 2 page website; The Home page primarily acts as a single scrolling page for all sections, with the portfolio page having the ability to be expanded on a different page to view more information on the various portfolio works. On the right top is the navigation bar, that includes links to each of the sections on the home page. It is a fixed bar that remains visible on the users screen at all times.

## Design Choices

### Colour Scheme

The final color scheme chosen is an off, almost matte like black, with an off white text and section background. A lighter black and mid grey is used for subtle sectioning with the pure white being used as a highlight. The colors were chosen to create a clean and minimal design throughout the website.

### Typography

There is only one font type chose, keeping in line with the clean design that is throughout the entire site, which is Roboto. Various weights and sizes are used to achieve emphasis and distinguish between headings and text blocks. Making use of letter spacing and line heights really give way to that modern, clean feel.
